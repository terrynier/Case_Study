Digital embracement to provide customer- centricity was at the top of most payments executives’ agendas and will remain a 2021 focal point. Banks are actively adopting a curate-and-collaborate approach to develop in-house capabilities by collaborating with agile players. COVID-19 was a catalyst to prioritize risk management as it triggered security awareness and safety efforts. A unified industry framework to combat fraud becomes the priority, especially in open networks.

Non-cash transaction continues its strong and steady forward march, as digital payments adoption among customers heightens. Growth is being driven by rapidly increasing smartphone penetration, a booming e-commerce segment, flourishing adoption of digital wallets, and innovations – primarily mobile–and QR-code payments.
